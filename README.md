# Introduction
  MIDIspread turns a dataset into a midi file.

  Currently it accesses a periodic table google sheet and makes an incredibly repetitive audio representation of periodic table table in midi.mid.

# Usage
  Python3.6 is currently recommended, but any version should be OK.
  Clone into working directory and call: `$python3.6 convert.py`
